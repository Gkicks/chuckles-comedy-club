# Design

## Colour Scheme

* Three colours have been used throughout the website - #F6F4F3, #002962 and #a0001c
* I chose colours to reflect those of the American flag – red, white and blue
* I began with a colour pallette from the website Coolors that reflected these colours:

![Coolers red to blue nine colour image](assets/readme-images/coolers-img-1.png)

* I wanted the white to be an off white, to make the website easier on the eye, so again chose a colour from the coolers website. I took this from another red / blue pallette so this would compliment the red and blue shades already chosen

![Coolers red to blue five colour image](assets/readme-images/coolers-img-2.png)

## Typography

* I used Fontjoy, a font pairing website, to help me make font choices. I selected Kalam, a cursive font, as I felt that reflected the comedy theme. This font was only used for the logo and submit button as I wanted simpler fonts throughout the rest of the website – I chose Biryani and Tinos as these fonts

![fonjoy screenshot](assets/readme-images/fontjoy.png)

* To give interest to the social media links I took icons from the website <https://fontawesome.com/icons>

## Imagery

### Favicon

* I created the favicon from the website <https://www.favicon.cc>

![favicon](assets/readme-images/favicon.png)

* I wanted the favicon to be an image of the American flag, both to refelct the USP of the venue and the colours used throughout the website
* The images of the American flag I found were too detailed to use as a favicon so, I chose to create my own, to create a simple image

### Hero Image

* I found this image on the website pixabay.com
* The original image had the word ‘comedy’ in neon green letters. The did not match the colour scheme of the website so I cropped this part of the image out

### Map

* I used the website <https://www.maps.ie/create-google-map/> to generate a map of the location of the club and to create an iframe to embed in my index.html page

### Comedian and Flag Images

* These  images were all found on the website <https://unsplash.com/>.

All images were converted to .webp format to reduce file size and therfore speed up loading times

## Wireframes

* Wireframes were created using figma.com

### Desktop

# Features

## Existing Features

### The Navigation Bar

* The navigation bar features on all three pages of the Chuckles Comedy Club website. It includes links to the home, what’s on and signup pages as well as links to the address and opening hours sections of the home page. The navigation bar also features a logo which will direct the user back to the home page
* The navigation bar is identical on each individual page to support the cohesiveness of the website
* The navigation is fully responsive and allows the user to easily navigate throughout the website
* Each navigation item includes an aria-label to improve accessibility for those using assistive technology

![Screenshot od navigation bar](assets/readme-images/navbar.png)

### The Landing Page

* The landing page includes a hero image of a microphone in front of a brick wall. There are text boxes, overlaying the image, which contain the name of the club and a slogan explaining the unique selling point of the club. When the user first lands on the website the colour of these boxes switches. This draws the user’s eye to this important information as well as giving some interest to the page

![Landing Page Screenshot](assets/readme-images/hero-image.png)

### Information Section

* The information section gives the user the address (a fake address has been used) and opening hours of the club
* It features an interactive map with a link for the user to be able to view a larger map. This opens in a new browser page which prevents the user needing to press the back button or closing the webpage in error

![Information bar screenshot](assets/readme-images/information.png)

### Footer

* The footer features on all three main pages of the website as well as the thank you page following the user completing the signup form
* The footer contain links to the social media sites Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Chuckles Comedy Club currently doesn’t have social media pages but, once these are created, the links will link to these
* The styling of the footer reflects that of the header to simplify the user experience
* The footer does not contain aria-labels as the words already explain what the link is for

![Footer screenshot](assets/readme-images/footer.png)

### Whats On

* The What’s On page shows the user the acts that will be performing the coming weekend
* There are three performers shown each night and each performer is shown with their name (fake names used), photo and a short audio clip of their stand-up routine

![What's on screenshot](assets/readme-images/whatson.png)

### Sign Up

* The Sign Up page allows users to sign up to receive emails and special offers for upcoming events
* The background image used is an American flag to symbolise the nationality of the comics performing
* There are three input fields for the user to enter their forename, surname and email address. These have aria-labels to improve accessibility for those users using assistive technology
* All three inputs require data to be entered before allowing the user to submit the form. The email input requires the data to be entered in the form of an email address
* There is also a select dropdown box that would be used to collect data, for the comedy club, to be able to pinpoint where to focus their marketing strategy

![Sign up screenshot](assets/readme-images/signup.png)

### Thank You

* The thank you page is displayed when the sign up form is submitted. This gives the user confirmation that their request has been received
* There is a 'Return to Home' button so the user can easily navigate back te Home page

![Thank you screenshot](assets/readme-images/thankyou.png)

### 404.html

* Following advice from my mentor I added a custom 404.html page. This will be displayed if a user makes a typing error when entering the url of the website
- There is a 'Return to Home' button so the user can easily navigate back te Home page

![404 error page screenshot](assets/readme-images/404.png)

## Future Implications

* The functionality to be able to purchase tickets, to performances, through the website
* More information about venue facilities – i.e., food and drink menus, disability access
* Search function to allow users to search the website
* A FAQ page to be added
* Transcripts to be added to the audio elements
* Functionality to be added for a non-technical administrator to be able to upload upcoming acts
* Social media sites to be developed for Chuckles Comedy Club

## Accessibility

* All pages use semantic html
* Aria-labels were used to improve accessibility for those using assistive technology. These are in all links apart from those in the footer. This is due to the footer text already telling those using a screen reader where the link would take them
* I used the Google Chrome extensions:
  * Web Disability Simulator – simulated the website for people with sight, mobility, reading and writing and concentration disabilities to view the webpage how others could see it. There were no concerns noted in these simulations
  * Screen Reader – Simulated how the website experience would be for a user using a screen reader. There were no concerns noted using this simulation
  * I used https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to check the contrasts of the colours chosen. This passed for both combinations of red and white (contrast ratio 7
.62:1) and blue and white (contrast ratio 12.82:1). This failed for the blue and red combination (contrast ratio 1.68:1) so this was not used in the website

### Wave Validator

I used the Wave validator to check if I could improve the user experience of the webpage for those with disabilities.

#### Home Page

When I first ran the validator there were two alerts but no errors:
	
* It detected that the tagline ‘bringing the best, of the US, to the UK!’ was in a paragraph element but looked like a header. I changed the paragraph element to an h2 which resolved this

![wave validation home page](assets/readme-images/wave-homepage.png)

* The second alert was that it was showing that the ‘Home’ nav link was redundant as there was an adjacent link to the same page. This is because the logo also links to the Home Page. I looked at the website https://www.nngroup.com/articles/homepage-links/ that detailed it was best practice for the logo to link to the Home Page, as that’s what user’s have come to expect. I decided to also leave the nav link to the Home Page in as I believe this will make the site easier to navigate, for the majority or users, while having minimal impact on those with disabilities. This alert was the same across all pages

![wave contrast screenshot](assets/readme-images/contrast.png)

#### What's On Page

There were seven alerts and no errors. One alert was due to the redundant home nav link, as above. The other six alerts were due to the audio not having a transcript. I tried to find a way to add a transcript to the audio but was unable to do this without ruining the look of the page. This would be an opportunity for further development

![wave validation what's on page](assets/readme-images/wave-whatson.png)

#### Sign Up Page

When I first ran the validator there were two alerts but no errors. The first alert was due to the redundant home nav link, as above. The second alert was because of an incorrect heading order. Wave showed that there was an h1 element, and two h3 elements, but no h2 element. This was resolved by changing the first h3 element (Sign up for our newsletter…) to an h2 element

![wave validation whats on page](assets/readme-images/wave-signup.png)

#### Thank You Page

This showed one error that the page had a redirect and this can pose difficulties for screen reader users.

# Testing

I tested the website in the following browsers:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox

I also used Chrome Developer tools to test how the screen looked and worked on each device screen and also used these tools to look for bugs throughout designing and building the website.

I posted a link to my website in the slack channel peer-code-review, but didn’t get any comments left, so I asked friends and family to test the website on their devices. There was one concern raised from this which was that the audio elements didn’t stop playing when another audio element started. This meant that the audio could all play over each other. I fixed this by finding some lines of JavaScript code (see credits section)

## WC3 Validator

I ran my HTML and CSS through the WC3 Validators. These were the errors that were returned from doing this:

* The validator returned that some of the code in the iframe was obsolete. I removed these parts as not needed

![Iframe obsolete screenshot](assets/readme-images/iframe-obsolete.png)

* WC3 validator returned that the iframe should not contain a link. I fixed this by removing the link code and the iframe still worked as it should

![Iframe link screenshot](assets/readme-images/iframe-link.png)

* The button on my thankyou.html page contained a link to return the user back to the home screen. The WC3 validator said a button cannot have a link. This was solved by wrapping the button in a form where the action was ‘index.html’

![screenshot button link](assets/readme-images/button-thankyou.png)

* There was an issue validating the code to automatically redirect the user back to the homepage, from the thankyou.html page. This was solved by adding URL= to index.html in the meta line

![screenshot url index](assets/readme-images/url-index.png)

* The validator showed a warning that my code lacked headings. I solved this by changing a p section to an h2

![screenshot p to h2](assets/readme-images/p-h2-index.png)

* There were other minor issues found, such as there being an extra /li in my code, or a space in an id, that were resolved straight away

The website now passes all WC3 validation for each page:  

![screenshot wc3 validator](assets/readme-images/wc3-validator.png)

## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

* The links in the navigation bar and footer were ‘jerky’ when hovered over. This was due to a border being added when the user hovers over the link.
  * Solution – I added a border to all the links and gave this border the same attributes as the hover border, except the colour, which matched the background colour so it didn’t display
* The hero image was taking a long time to download
  * Solution – initially I added a preload instuction into the head of the html. I took this advice from the website wpspeedmatters.com/speed-up-background-images/. However, on further reasearch, I realised this wasn’t best practice and so removed this and focused on reducing the file size and converting the jpeg to webp. I also added loading=”lazy” to iframe to free up processing time for main-photo
* The nav bar was quickly distorting on smaller screens
  * Solution – I changed the display to flex
* There was an area of blank screen to the right side of each page
  * Solution – I added overflow-x: hidden to the body and html, using css
* Pressing the ‘submit’ button in signup.html was not taking the user to the thankyou.html page
  * Solution - Following discussion with my mentor I removed method:post (this is only needed if there is a backend database in place)
* The border, on the select element of signup.html, was turning black when the option was changed
  * Solution – I changed the border to an outline, following advice from the website <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492627/change-border-color-on-select-html-form>
* Although the background image, on the signup.html page, was loading from app.codeacademy this was not loading on the deployed site
  * Solution - With help from Tutor Support I found there was a / in front of asset, in my filepath, that shouldn’t have been there. This was removed
* The audio elements were playing over each other
  * Solution – I copied JavaScript code from the website <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19790506/multiple-audio-html-auto-stop-other-when-current-is-playing-with-javascript>
* On the advice of my mentor I combined the original find us and opening hours nav links into one nav link (club info). This was to improve the user experience as there were two links going to the same part of the page. During testing following this I found the links to the club info section didn't work when navigating from the what's on and sign up pages
  * Solution - I hadn't added the index.html to the beginning of the href. I added this to both and the navigation worked 

### Unresolved Bugs

None that I know of

# Credits

## Code Used

1.
        document.addEventListener('play', function (e) {
            var audios = document.getElementsByTagName('audio');
            for (var i = 0, len = audios.length; i < len; i++) {
                if (audios[i] != e.target) {
                    audios[i].pause();
                }
            }
        }, true);

This code was taken from the website <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19790506/multiple-audio-html-auto-stop-other-when-current-is-playing-with-javascript> and was used for the audio elements so that, when another audio was played, the current one playing would stop

2.

![Screenshot of code used for automatic redirect](assets/readme-images/credit-auto-redirect-thankyou.png)

I adapted this code, from the website <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-automatically-redirect-a-Web-Page-to-another-URL> to automatically divert the user from the page thankyou.html, to index.html, after five seconds
